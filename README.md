In this fork of the project, a version of user access control using [anonymous usage tokens](https://github.com/AdamISZ/aut-ct) is being developed. This serves as a proof of concept of that functionality. All the changes made to the forum software here are fairly trivial and devoted to that goal.

This autct implementation is being done *only* on the branch `no-captcha` (because it replaces captchas).
