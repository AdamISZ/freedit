<b>Getting the public key set for your zero knowledge proof of ownership.</b>

<div class="">
    Making proofs (as described on <a href="./proofs">this page</a>) requires you to have the right set of public keys,
    derived from taproot utxos that existed at a specific block height.
    <br>
    On this page there will always be a link to the <emph>latest</emph> utxo keyset file in use by
    this server. Proofs should be generated with that keyset. They were generated from the utxo snapshot at the specified blockheight.
    As long as you had a taproot utxo at that specific blockheight for which you own the private key, you can generate the proof.

    <br><br>
    Trusting the server to generate the keyset file for you is not great! It's just to make the proof
    of concept easier.
    While it doesn't violate the
    security of your private keys, it theoretically makes the anonymity of your key weaker, if the server
    is malicious.
    <br>
    In future you can generate the keyset yourself, with your own bitcoin node. And you can do that today;
    read <a href="./">here</a> for how to do that; note that it will take 30-40 minutes at minimum, but for
    the technically capable, it's not too hard, if you have the motivation.
